Have you ever wanted to be productive after work but are constantly exhausted? That was me until I discovered these few things that helped me stop wasting my evenings.

## Force a Transitional Activity

The bug is fixed, feature PR tidy and tied. Laptop shut and I tell myself a 30 min cooking show sesh would be perfect post work. Too often that plop on the couch turns into an hour+ of wathing, and before long the evening is a wash. 

For the longest time I couldn't figure out how to stop this cycle. I was tired, and I needed to rest. But then I came across this research paper around attention restoration

> Attention restoration: When one part of your body is exhausted, you should use the non-exhausted portion to reset your energy levels. 

And I did some thinking and realized my most productive days were when I ended a day of programming with a workout or dog walk. After that I would find myself hacking on side projects after a quick cook, or even motivated to deep clean the apartment ;).

That's when it clicked! You need a transitional activity to reset yourself.

A Transitional activity is simply doing something different! A 
    1. Mentally exhausted -> go for a walk
    - Go for a walk
    - Cook a meal

    2. Physically exhausted -> do something stimulating or stagnant!
    - Catch up on that Wordle backlog 
    - Read a book or Medidate <insert emojis>

## Work with your chronotype 

2. Work with your chronotype, not against it… 
    1. If you’re a morning person, don’t Fight it!

## The "Other Day" rule

3. 1 Rule other day -> Pick a day to not be productive.. force yourself to chill and disconnect 
    1. Body and mind run in cycles.. push, rest, repeat.. push, rest, repeat 
    2. Follow this strategy by giving yourself permission to take up to two days off a week from being productive in the evenings or mornings..
        1. You don’t actually have to use both days every week.. If you want to melt into your couch and watch severance.. then go just do it
    3. Never take two other days in a row… 

# Nutrients nutrients nutrients

4. Lack of nutrients 

# Task stacking 

5. Task stacking 
    1. When you’re working out, listen to a podcast 
    2. Do things when you commute 

6. Principal list groups -> Note taking system with a daily and weekly review system
