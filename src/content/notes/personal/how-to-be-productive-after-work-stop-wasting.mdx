# How to be productive after work! Stop wasting evenings

1. Transitional activity -> do something different

1. Mentally exhausted -> go for a walk
2. Physically exhausted -> do something stagnant

2. Work with your chronotype, not against it…

1. If you’re a morning person, don’t Fight it!

3. 1 Rule other day -> Pick a day to not be productive.. force yourself to chill and disconnect

1. Body and mind run in cycles.. push, rest, repeat.. push, rest, repeat
2. Follow this strategy by giving yourself permission to take up to two days off a week from being productive in the evenings or mornings..

1. You don’t actually have to use both days every week.. If you want to melt into your couch and watch severance.. then go just do it

3. Never take two other days in a row…

4. Lack of nutrients
5. Task stacking

1. When you’re working out, listen to a podcast
2. Do things when you commute

6. Principal list groups -> Note taking system with a daily and weekly review system
