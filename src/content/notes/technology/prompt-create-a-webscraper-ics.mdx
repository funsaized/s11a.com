# Prompt: Create a webscraper -> ICS

I want to create a typescript serverless function. It should fetch events from a configured site that returns a html page, aggregate the event info including title, location, time, etc. Then, it should create individual ICS (ical) events for each event and add to a configured calendar. Be sure to include proper date timezone detection logic when pulling the information and when creating the ical event. Assume ET for ical event creation. It should use Vercel. It should take an anthropic API key and leverage the cheapest AI model available there to bolster processing logic intelligently.
