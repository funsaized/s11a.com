# Apple notes -> Markdown image extraction plane

1. Run shortcut -> Notes placed in content/notes.
2. Run convert file and script to stage notes in working dir
3. (Parallel to 1) we can run AppleScript Automation ExportNotesHtml.workflow to put files in Html stage
4. Custom script that iterates notes in working directory from (2) and names the images Image-
   .png/jpeg,etc

1. Marry staging images from (4) w/ staging MDX file from (2) into directory
2. Move staged dirs -> blog src/content/notes/&lttag>

1. Script should be tag aware

Automate the above w/ CRON. Orchestrate w/ bash or node whatever platform supports
