# Gatsby Blog Migration initial prompt

/sc:implement &quotI have an existing Gatsby blog at s11a.com with 74+ articles. I want to create a new version using Gatsby 5, Tailwind CSS v3, and shadcn/ui.

Here's my existing source at ../s11a/ for reference.

Please create a modern version that:

1. Maintains the same functionality

2. Uses Tailwind utility classes

3. Incorporates shadcn/ui components where appropriate

4. Follows React/TypeScript best practices

5. Includes proper error handling and loading states

Provide the complete implementation with explanations. Follow create-and-migrate-blog-prd.md in its ENTIRETY to guide your implementation. There are 8 Sessions outlined in 6. Development workflow. Treat each session as a complex sequence of tasks to implement, and after each session, pause implementation until I tell you to continue after I verify functionality. Use playwright mcp to verify output. Use shadcn for all ui components via the shadcn cli and use the shadcn-ui MCP whenever you create UI components. —c7 —sequential —think-hard . Use parallel sub agents where it makes sense.
