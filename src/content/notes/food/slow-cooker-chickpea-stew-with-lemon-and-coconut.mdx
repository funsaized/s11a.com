# Slow Cooker Chickpea Stew With Lemon and Coconut

Soothing yet bright, this soup tastes like something that took careful attention, but really just requires throwing five ingredients into a slow cooker and letting it cook for hours. Dried chickpeas and cauliflower soften in the gentle heat, and the coconut milk thickens as the mixture cooks, seasoned with earthy turmeric and sweet lemon peel. Reminiscent of curries throughout South and Southeast Asia, it can be eaten over rice, or with sliced almonds or cilantro on top, but it can just as well stand alone.

## Recipe Details

**Prep Time:** 5 minutes **Cook Time:** 6-8 hours **Total Time:** 6-8 hours **Servings:** 4-6 servings **Difficulty:** Easy

## Ingredients

- 1 pound dried chickpeas (no need to soak)
- 1 head cauliflower (about 2 pounds), cut into big florets
- 2 (14-ounce) cans full-fat coconut milk
- 1 tablespoon ground turmeric
- Salt and black pepper
- 2 lemons
- Water (enough to just cover the cauliflower)

## Equipment

- 5- to 8-quart slow cooker
- Vegetable peeler

## Instructions

1. In a 5- to 8-quart slow cooker, combine the chickpeas, cauliflower, coconut milk, turmeric and generous pinches of salt and pepper. Use a vegetable peeler to peel wide strips of zest from the lemons, then add to the slow cooker. Add enough water to just cover the cauliflower.
2. Cover and cook on low until the beans and cauliflower are tender, 6 to 8 hours.
3. Stir in the juice of half the lemon, then season to taste with salt, pepper and more lemon juice until the soup is rich and bright. The strips of lemon peel are deliciously sweet and floral, not at all bitter, but feel free to discard if you prefer.

## Tips & Notes

- The predominant lemon flavor isn't tangy but rather floral from the peels releasing their oils into the stew
- The strips of lemon peel become deliciously sweet and floral after cooking - not bitter at all
- Can be served over rice or topped with sliced almonds or cilantro
- Works well as a standalone meal
- The coconut milk naturally thickens as it cooks with the chickpeas

## Storage

Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. Reheat gently on stovetop or microwave, adding a splash of water if needed to thin.
