    * 2 tablespoons chipotle chili powder 
    * ½ teaspoon smoked paprika
    * ½ teaspoon cayenne pepper
    * ½ teaspoon garlic powder
    * 1 teaspoon honey
    * 1 teaspoon soy sauce
    * ¼ teaspoon black pepper

  * ½ teaspoon garlic powder
  * 1 cup cooked forbidden rice

**Preparation**




  1. Gather all ingredients and preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

Add salmon, chipotle chili powder, smoked paprika, cayenne, garlic powder, honey, soy sauce, black pepper and lemon zest  to a small bowl, mix until evenly combined. Add to ½ of your lined baking tray and place in the oven for about 12-15 minutes or until tender and flakey. 
  4. Rinse the small bowl and add broccoli and asparagus. Lightly toss in avocado oil, chili powder, paprika, garlic powder, lemon juice, salt and pepper. Add to the baking sheet and cook for an additional 10 minutes with the salmon. 
  5. Assemble the bowl by first placing a base of rice. Add asparagus, broccoli and arugula.  Add salmon and garnish with a chipotle ranch. Enjoy! 




**Tips & Notes**

****


  * Dark meat ground chicken works best for richness and moisture
  * Don't move the cabbage too quickly - let it get charred for better flavor
  * The baking soda helps keep the meat tender and helps it brown faster
  * Sambal oelek can be adjusted to taste for heat preference
