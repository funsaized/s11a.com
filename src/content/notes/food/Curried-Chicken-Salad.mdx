**Ingredients:**

  


  * 2 large chicken breasts, boiled and finely diced 
  * 2 celery stalks, finely diced
  * 1 Honeycrisp apple, finely diced
  * 2 tablespoons fresh dill, chopped
  * 2 green onions, finely sliced
  * 1 cup red grapes, halved
  * 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
  * 1 1/2 tablespoons seeded stone ground mustard
  * 1/2 cup Greek yogurt
  * 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
  * 1 teaspoon curry powder
  * 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
  * Salt, to taste
  * Fresh cracked black pepper, to taste

  


**Instructions:**

  


  1. **Boil the Chicken**: Bring a pot of water to a gentle boil, adding a pinch of salt. Add chicken breasts and cook for 15-20 minutes, or until just cooked through. Avoid overcooking to keep the chicken juicy. Remove from the pot and allow to cool completely. Once cooled, finely dice the chicken.
  2. **Combine Ingredients**: In a large bowl, add the diced chicken, celery, dill, green onion, Dijon mustard, seeded mustard, Greek yogurt, lemon juice, curry powder, cumin, salt, and fresh cracked black pepper. Stir gently until everything is well combined.
  3. **Fold in the Grapes and Apples**: Carefully fold in the halved grapes and diced apple, ensuring they stay intact.
  4. **Chill**: Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before serving to allow the flavors to meld.
  5. **Refrigerate** in an airtight container and enjoy for up to 4 days.
