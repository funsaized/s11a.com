## Recipe Details

**Prep Time:** 20 min

**Cook Time:** 30 min

**Total Time:** 50 min

**Servings:** 5

**Difficulty: Easy**

**Ingredients:**

- **1 cup farro**, rinsed
- **2 cups water** or vegetable broth
- **1 lb green beans**, trimmed
- **2 tbsp butter**
- **1 tbsp avocado oil**
- **1/2 cup walnuts**, roughly chopped
- **2 tbsp spicy honey**
- **1/4 cup fresh dill**, chopped
- **1 lemon**, juice and zest
- **Salt** **and pepper,** to taste

**Instructions:**

1. Cook farro via package instructions or in a medium saucepan, toast the rinsed farro over medium heat for 2-3 minutes until fragrant. Add water or broth and a pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for about 30 minutes, or until the farro is tender and the liquid is absorbed. Or cook via package instructions. Remove from heat and let it sit, covered, for 5 minutes.
2. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the green beans and cook for 3 minutes until bright green and tender-crisp. Drain and immediately plunge the beans into ice water to stop the cooking process (shocking). Drain again once cool.
3. Heat 1 tablespoon of butter and avocado oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the blanched green beans, season with salt and pepper, and sauté until seared and slightly caramelized, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat.
4. In the same skillet, add the remaining butter, walnuts, and spicy honey (or honey, and chili flakes). Saute over medium-high heat, until the walnuts are toasted and coated with the spicy honey, about 3-4 minutes. Be careful not to burn the nuts.
5. In a large serving bowl, combine the cooked farro with the seared green beans. Add the toasted walnuts, fresh dill, lemon zest, and lemon juice. Toss everything together until well mixed. Adjust seasoning with additional salt, pepper, or lemon juice if needed.
6. Serve warm.

This dish combines the nuttiness of farro, the crisp freshness of green beans, and the sweet-spicy crunch of walnuts, all brought together with the bright flavor of fresh dill and lemon. It's perfect for a nutritious meal that doesn't compromise on flavor.

**## Tips & Notes**

- Dark meat ground chicken works best for richness and moisture
- Don't move the cabbage too quickly - let it get charred for better flavor
- The baking soda helps keep the meat tender and helps it brown faster
- Sambal oelek can be adjusted to taste for heat preference

## Storage

Store leftovers in refrigerator for up to 4 days.
