**Ingredients**

  


  * 3 cups shishito peppers
  * 2 teaspoons avocado oil (enough to coat the bottom of a medium-large skillet)
  * 1 teaspoon reduced sodium soy sauce or coconut aminos 
  * ½ teaspoon honey 
  * ½ teaspoon red pepper flake 
  * 1 teaspoon rice wine vinegar
  * Season with salt to taste (
  * 1⁄2 cup brown rice

  


**Preparation**

  


  1. Rinse and pat shishito peppers dry. Gather all ingredients, a medium mixing bowl and a medium-large skillet.
  2. Transfer peppers to the medium bowl and drizzle in olive oil, honey, red pepper flakes and soy sauce. Set aside.
  3. Lightly coat the bottom of your skillet with a neutral oil. Bring to heat and add the peppers. Allow the peppers to sizzle and pop before mixing/flipping/stirring. You want to develop blistered char spots. 
  4. Once you achieve that desired doneness, bring the heat up and deglaze with your rice wine vinegar. Give the peppers a good stir while scraping the bottom of the pan. Transfer to a serving plate and sprinkle in salt. 
  5. Serve hot.
