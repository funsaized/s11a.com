## Ingredients

- 1 cup Greek yogurt (plain)
- 1/2 cup cooked chickpeas (cooked from scratch or drained and rinsed canned chickpeas), patted dry
- 2 hard-boiled eggs, grated
- 2 Persian cucumbers, chopped
- 2 Roma tomatoes, chopped
- Extra virgin olive oil (for drizzling)
- Kosher salt
- Za'atar and/or Dukkah (for serving)

## Equipment

- 2 serving bowls
- Box grater (for grating eggs)
- Knife and cutting board

## Instructions

1. **Prep ingredients:** If needed, hard-boil eggs and prepare chickpeas. Drain and rinse canned chickpeas if using. Chop tomatoes and cucumbers.
2. **Build the breakfast bowl:** Divide the yogurt into the bottom of two serving bowls (1/2 cup each).
3. **Add toppings:** Using the largest side of a box grater, grate one egg onto each bowl (or chop if preferred). Top with chickpeas and fresh veggies.
4. **Finish and serve:** Add a drizzle of good extra virgin olive oil, a pinch of salt, and a good sprinkle of za'atar or dukkah. Serve immediately or cover and refrigerate for up to 1 night.

## Tips & Notes

- **Make-ahead option:** Boil eggs and keep unpeeled in the fridge for up to 5 days. Rinse and strain chickpeas and store in the fridge. Chop veggies and build bowls just before serving.
- **Dairy-free option:** Substitute Greek yogurt with hummus, beet hummus, or avocado hummus.
- **Vegetable variations:** Try sliced bell peppers, sweet mini peppers, radishes, or fennel for variety.
- **Add more crunch:** Top with crispy quinoa or use roasted chickpeas instead of regular chickpeas.
- **Mediterranean additions:** Include olives, sun-dried tomatoes, or roasted red peppers.
- **Spice alternatives:** If you don't have za'atar or dukkah, use Italian seasoning or fresh herbs (parsley, dill, mint, cilantro) with nuts/seeds for texture.
- **Extra flavor:** Grate garlic into the yogurt or mix with fresh herbs. Top with sliced red or green onions.
- **Add heat:** Top with harissa, Aleppo pepper, Urfa biber, or zhoug (spicy cilantro sauce).

## Storage

- **Assembled bowls:** Can be covered and refrigerated for up to 1 night.
- **Meal prep components:** Store hard-boiled eggs (unpeeled) in a sealed container for up to 5 days. Keep prepared chickpeas refrigerated for up to 3 days.
