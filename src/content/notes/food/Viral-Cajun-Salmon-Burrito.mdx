_Notes_**: **

  


-These burritos are incredibly versatile, feel free to  make ingredient swaps to avoid an unnecessary trip to the grocery store. 

\- If you don't have an air-fryer, you can cook the salmon in the oven at 400, it just might take a bit longer to reach appropriate doneness.

Cook time 14 minutes 

Total 35 minutes 

  


**Ingredients**

  


  * 2 large flour tortilla
  * Salmon (1 lb or one filet)
  * 1 teaspoon cajun seasoning 
  * 1 teaspoon of cooking oil of choice 
  * ½ teaspoon honey 
  * S/P to taste
  * 1 cup pico de gallo
  * 1 cup diced tomatoes 
  * ¾ cup chopped cilantro 
  * ½ white onion, diced
  * 4 tbsp lime juice
  * Salt to taste
  * 1 cup cilantro lime rice
  * Cook rice according to package directions
  * Add ½ cup finely chopped cilantro
  * 1-2 tbsp lime juice
  * 1 cup shredded cabbage mix
  * 1 tbsp spicy mayo 
  * Other additions: avocado, shredded romaine,  black beans etc. 

  


**Preparation**

  


  1. Gather all ingredients and preheat the oven or air fryer to 400 degrees F. 
  2. Take salmon filet and pat dry with paper towels. Cover in cajun seasoning, tsp of cooking oil and drizzle of honey. Finish with a dash of salt and lime. Lightly massage seasonings into fish and allow to marinade for 5-10 minutes. Place in air fryer for 12-13 minutes or until flakey (desired doneness).
  3. While you allow the fish to marinade, throw the rice on the stove (depending on rice/quantity should take ~15 minutes to cook). Cook rice according to package directions. Once the rice is cooked, fluff with a fork and add chopped cilantro and lime. Fold to combine. 
  4. Make pico by combining your chopped ingredients (tomato, cilantro, onion, lime, salt). 
  5. To assemble burritos, warm tortillas for the best manipulation. Begin to stack the burrito components, order does not matter. You have cilantro lime rice, pico, cabbage, crispy salmon, spicy mayo, and whatever else you desire ie: black beans, romaine, avocado. Utilize roughly 2/3 cup of rice, 1/2 cup pico, 1/4 cup cabbage in each burrito.
  6. Wrap tightly and to take this burrito to the next level, add a tbsp of cooking oil to a large pan on med high heat.  
  7. Once the oil is hot, place the wrapped burrito in the pan and press down lightly with spatula. Allow the tortilla to crisp and develop a golden brown color, flip and repeat. 
  8. Take off heat and place on a cutting board. Using a serrated knife, cut at a diagonal. Serve hot and enjoy with additional pico de gallo and whatever toppings you enjoy. I love using greek yogurt in place of sour cream for ex flavor, creaminess and protein. 
  9. Enjoy!! Can’t wait to see your creations.
