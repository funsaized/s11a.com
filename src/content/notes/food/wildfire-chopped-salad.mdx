5. **Dress and serve:** Add dressing to taste and toss to coat evenly. Serve immediately.

## Tips & Notes

- For best results, ensure all ingredients are chilled before assembling
- Add avocado and tortilla chips just before serving to prevent browning and sogginess
- Can substitute grilled shrimp or steak for chicken
- Fresh corn can be grilled for extra flavor, or frozen corn can be used if fresh is unavailable
- Make extra dressing to store for future salads

## Storage

- Store undressed salad components separately in airtight containers for up to 2 days
- Dressing can be refrigerated for up to 1 week
- Best enjoyed fresh; do not store dressed salad
