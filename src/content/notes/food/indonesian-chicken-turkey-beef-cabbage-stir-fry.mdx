## Recipe Details

**Prep Time:** 15 min

**Cook Time:** 15 min

**Total Time:** 30 min

**Servings:** 4

**Difficulty: Easy**

If available, seek out ground chicken made from dark meat, which will be naturally richer and perform best when cooked. Though this recipe's technique of incorporating baking soda, sugar, and a bit of neutral oil will allow the meat to stay juicier and brown faster no matter what grind you use. Green cabbage is the move here versus other greens as it can take a hard sear and not wilt away, so don't be afraid to let it get charred around the edges before moving it around.

## Ingredients

- 2 Tbsp. oyster sauce
- 2 Tbsp. sambal oelek
- 2 Tbsp. unseasoned rice vinegar
- 1 Tbsp. fish sauce
- 1 Tbsp. plus ½ tsp. dark brown sugar
- 4 Tbsp. vegetable oil, divided
- ½ medium head of green cabbage (about 1¼ lb.), cored, leaves cut into 2" pieces
- 1 lb. ground chicken, beef, or pork
- 1 tsp. Diamond Crystal or ½ tsp. Morton kosher salt
- ½ tsp. baking soda
- 6 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
- 1 1" piece ginger, peeled, very finely chopped
- 1 bunch scallions, thinly sliced, divided
- 2 Tbsp. unsalted butter

## Equipment

- Large skillet or wok
- Sharp knife
- Cutting board
- 2 mixing bowls
- Wooden spoon or spatula

## Instructions

1. Stir 2 Tbsp. oyster sauce, 2 Tbsp. sambal oelek, 2 Tbsp. rice vinegar, 1 Tbsp. fish sauce, and 1 Tbsp. brown sugar in a small bowl; set sauce aside.
2. Heat 2 Tbsp. oil in a large skillet or wok over high heat. Add cabbage and cook, tossing occasionally, until lightly charred and crisp-tender, 4-6 minutes. Transfer to a plate.
3. Meanwhile, mix ground chicken, salt, baking soda, and remaining ½ tsp. brown sugar in a bowl with your hands until well combined.
4. Heat remaining 2 Tbsp. oil in same skillet over high heat. Add chicken mixture and cook, breaking up with a spoon, until browned and cooked through, 4-5 minutes.
5. Add garlic, ginger, and half of scallions to skillet with chicken. Cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 1 minute.
6. Return cabbage to skillet, add reserved sauce, and toss to combine. Remove from heat, add butter, and toss until melted. Top with remaining scallions.

## Tips & Notes

- Dark meat ground chicken works best for richness and moisture
- Don't move the cabbage too quickly - let it get charred for better flavor
- The baking soda helps keep the meat tender and helps it brown faster
- Sambal oelek can be adjusted to taste for heat preference

## Storage

Store leftovers in refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat in skillet over medium heat or in microwave.
