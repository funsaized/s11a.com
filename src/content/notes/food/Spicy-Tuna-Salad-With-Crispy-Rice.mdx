**Spicy Tuna Salad With Crispy Rice**




This recipe transforms the sushi-restaurant specialty of spicy tuna crispy rice — raw spicy tuna balanced atop bricks of seared rice — into a straightforward, pantry-friendly, any-night meal. Instead of portioning and frying rice, you can cook seasoned rice in a skillet until it crisps, then scoop it onto plates. The tuna stays spicy and creamy, but this recipe calls for humble canned tuna instead of raw.

**Recipe Details**




**Prep Time:** 5 minutes **Cook Time:** 30 minutes **Total Time:** 35 minutes **Servings:** 4 servings **Difficulty:** Easy




**Ingredients**




  * 1½ cups sushi rice, rinsed well
  * 1 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons unseasoned rice vinegar
  * 2 teaspoons granulated sugar
  * Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)
  * 3 scallions, trimmed
  * 2 Persian or mini seedless cucumbers
  * 4 (5-ounce) cans water-packed tuna, drained
  * ⅓ cup mayonnaise
  * 1½ tablespoons Sriracha, plus more to taste
  * 2 teaspoons soy sauce
  * 3 tablespoons neutral oil (such as grapeseed), plus more as needed




**Equipment**

****


  * Large nonstick skillet with lid
  * Large bowl
  * Knife and cutting board




**Instructions**




  1. In a large nonstick skillet with a lid, stir together 2 cups water, the rice, 1 tablespoon rice vinegar, the sugar and 1 teaspoon salt. Bring to a boil over high heat, then cover, reduce heat to low and cook until rice is tender, 18 to 20 minutes.
  2. Meanwhile, thinly slice the scallions and cucumbers. In a large bowl, stir together the scallions, tuna, mayonnaise, Sriracha, soy sauce and remaining 2 teaspoons rice vinegar. Taste and add more Sriracha for more heat. Refrigerate until the rice is ready (or up to 5 days).
  3. Sprinkle the cucumbers with a pinch of salt.
  4. Now crisp the rice: Make 4 or 5 small holes in the rice in the skillet, then pour the oil down the sides of the pan and into the divots. Increase heat to medium and cook until the rice is browned at the edges, 4 to 7 minutes. (You can lift the rice to check.) If you don't see oil bubbling in the holes, add a teaspoon or two more oil.
  5. Divide the rice, crispy side up, among bowls or plates and serve with a scoop of the spicy tuna and the cucumbers.




**Tips & Notes**




  * Sliced cucumbers add freshness, but feel free to embellish further with sprouts, avocado, nori sheets or jalapeño slices
  * Some variations that work well: 2 cups rice with 2 cups water, 1/4 cup rice wine vinegar, 2 cans tuna, less mayo and more sriracha
  * You can add chopped celery and carrots for more veggies and crunch
  * Top with green onions, toasted sesame seeds and sliced jalapeño pepper for extra flavor
  * Day-old rice could work for extra crispiness (like for fried rice)
  * The tuna mixture can be refrigerated for up to 5 days




**Storage**




The tuna salad mixture can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. Crispy rice is best served immediately but leftover rice can be reheated in a skillet with a bit of oil to re-crisp.
