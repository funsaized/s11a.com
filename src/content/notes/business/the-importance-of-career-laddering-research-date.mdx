# The importance of career laddering - Research - [Date]

## Problem/Question

What is career laddering? A system typically used to show what expectations are at different levels of a role, I.e defining how one might be promoted.

## Key Findings

To get **Senior**, you focus on you’re the best ‘you’ can be - you perform your role exceedingly well and you’ve reached a high potential for your own output

To get **Staff** , your focus is really to expand beyond yourself. You start teaching people things you’ve learned and help serve their needs.

To get **Principal**, you’re creating systems that scale beyond your role. You’re no longer helping folks be like you, **you’re helping them where they are.** A lot of activities enable the success of those around you.

In a semi-regular **Career Laddering Review**, go through every list in current and future role and self assess the progress you’ve made on each item.

**30/60/90**: Start with the work you want to accomplish in the next three months. Sometimes this can be quantifiable, sometimes it can be less measurable i.e ‘I would like to try to understand our component library a bit more as a newcomer”. Do the same for 30 day, and quickly for 60 day plan.

It is also important to go through what you shouldn’t be doing i.e things that aren’t useful to spend time on.

Revisit the 30/90 plan roughly every month..
