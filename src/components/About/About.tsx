            Hey there ðŸ‘‹! My name is Sai Nimmagadda. I currently work as a full
            stack software engineer and have a BSE in electrical and computer
            engineering and biomedical engineering from Duke.
          </p>
          <p>
            I&apos;m hoping to grow this site in parallel with my exploration of
            new tech and open-source software. I also created this site to keep
            myself on track: I love the excitement that comes with contributing
            to the web and wanted a way to combine my learning with
            contributing.
          </p>
          <p>
            I believe the best way to learn is through collaboration with
            others, so I&apos;ll be posting anything and everything I come
            across in the web that I think might be useful or interesting.
            Hopefully visitors will find the knowledge/rants here useful.
