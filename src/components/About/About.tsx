              Hey there ðŸ‘‹! My name is Sai Nimmagadda. I currently work as a full
              stack software engineer and have a BSE in electrical and computer
              engineering and biomedical engineering from Duke.
            </p>
            <p>
              I&apos;m hoping to grow this site in parallel with my exploration of
              new tech and open-source software. I also created this site to keep
              myself on track: I love the excitement that comes with contributing to
              the web and wanted a way to combine my learning with contributing.
            </p>
            <p>
              I believe the best way to learn is through collaboration with others,
              so I&apos;ll be posting anything and everything I come across in the
              web that I think might be useful or interesting. Hopefully visitors
              will find the knowledge/rants here useful.
