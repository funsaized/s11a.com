## Intro to batch processing
If you're someone looking for a refresher in the strategies and principles of batch processing, I would recommend a read-through of Spring's batch introduction [here](https://docs.spring.io/spring-batch/docs/current/reference/html/spring-batch-intro.html#spring-batch-intro). I found this portion of their docs super helpful. It does a great job providing background on batch processing and translating that to Spring Batch's architecture.
