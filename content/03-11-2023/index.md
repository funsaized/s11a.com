We will explore one of the essential features of Cosmos DB - pagination and continuation tokens. Below is a simple & practical implementation for using continuation tokens using the [JavaScript server-side SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cosmosdb-js-server/) to write the procedure and the [Java client SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cosmosdb-java) to execute.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account
- Basic JavaScript knowledge
- Basic Java knowledge

## Setting up a workspace
